# Installation

## Command Line Interface

If you have **Python** installed on your system you can use the following commands:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Bash" %}
```bash
$ pip install Summer-Project
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Cmd" %}
```python
> pip install Summer-Project
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not have\* PyPi on PATH, you may have to use:

```python
> python -m install Summer-Project
```
{% endhint %}

This will install the [latest release](https://pypi.org/project/Summer-Project/2.0/) onto your system.

If you want to install the dev releases or the most up-to-date version you must use the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ARU300/SummerProject.git
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This requires `git` to be installed on your system.
{% endhint %}
