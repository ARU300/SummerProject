# Installation

## Command Line Interface

If you have **Python** installed on your system you can use the following commands:

```bash
$ pip install Summer-Project
```

```python
> pip install Summer-Project
```

If you do not have\* PyPi on PATH, you may have to use:

```python
> python -m install Summer-Project
```

This will install the [latest release](https://pypi.org/project/Summer-Project/2.0/) onto your system.

If you want to install the dev releases or the most up-to-date version you must use the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ARU300/SummerProject.git
```
