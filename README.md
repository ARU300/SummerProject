**You are expected to design, code, and present to the class a programming project that has a purpose** *(solves a real problem)* **for a real life user.** 

## **Introduction**
* **Detailed** description of your project including *user/s* and *user requirements*.

* **Detailed** description of your *aims* – `SMART` objectives

### Description of current system in place or lack of system. 

* Who are the users?

## Design
	 
### **System Design**

* Show understanding of how to model a **complex** system by only including **essential** details.

* Use a `structure chart` to express the parameters passed between the various modules *(input, process, output)*.

* Identify `procedures/functions` which are part of the `algorithm` design.

* Describe the *purpose* of a structure chart.

* Construct a structure chart for the problem.

* Derive equivalent `pseudocode` from the structure chart.

* Document a simple algorithm using:
	* Structured English
	* `Pseudocode`
	* Program `flowchart`
	
## Testing
				 
### **System implementation** 

* Write the program in a high-level language (e.g. `Python` or `VB.net`)
		 
### **System Testing**

* Show awareness of why errors occur

* Show understanding of how **testing** can expose possible errors.

* Appreciate the significance of testing throughout software development.

* Show understanding of the methods of testing available: `dry run, walkthrough, white-box, black-box, integration, alpha, beta, acceptance.`

* Show understanding of the need for a *test strategy* and *test plan* and their likely contents.

* Choose **appropriate** test data *(normal, abnormal and extreme/boundary)* for a test plan.

## Review
		 
### **User Review**
* Ask your *prospective* users to test and provide **feedback** for your product.

* What **improvements** could you make in the future?

* Peer review from another member of the class.
		  
### **Project Evaluation**

* How did your project go?

* Was it a success, why/why not?

* How many of the `SMART` objectives did you meet – why/why not?
